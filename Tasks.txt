What needs to get done:
    -HTML-
    * Double-check all classes and id names
    * Make sure everything is nested properly
    * Change the instructions -- too boring

    -CSS-
    * Finish the styling of the webpage
    * Organize things under proper sections
    * Try to keep everything set as a class
    * Fix length of list items (way longer than the input box)

    -JS-
    * When an item is marked as completed (green), have it sent to the bottom of the list
